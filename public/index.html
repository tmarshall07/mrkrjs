  <div id="root">A placebo-controlled clinical trial is conducted to assess whether a new oral hypoglycemic agent is more effective than standard therapy. A total of 2000 patients with diabetes mellitus are enrolled and assigned to one of two groups. Half of the study participants are randomly assigned to receive the new drug, and half receive placebo. The investigators report that 100 patients receiving drug and 40 patients receiving placebo experience<span class="highlight">&nbsp;severe h</span><span class="highlight">eadaches. Based on these results, which o</span>f the following is the best estimate of the attributable risk of the new drug for headaches?</div>

        <p><i>[It is nighttime in Surrey, we see an owl on the street sign "PRIVET DRIVE" and the camera pans to the
                street with very identical looking brown bricked houses. The owl flies away and an elderly man with
                crimson robes and a long silvery white beard named Albus Dumbledore walks out of a forest near the
                street, past a tabby cat standing next to what looks like a shed. He takes out his deliminator and
                activates it. Dumbledore zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat
                meows. Dumbledore looks down at the cat.]</i>

            <dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.</dd>
            <dd><i>[The cat silently looks at him, and the camera turns towards a wall. The cat's shadow turns into a
                    woman with a tall hat. There are footsteps and Minerva McGongall is revealed.]</i></dd>
            <dd><b>McGonagall</b>: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?</dd>
            <dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.</dd>
            <dd><b>McGonagall</b>: And the boy?</dd>
            <dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: Hagrid is bringing him.</dd>
            <dd><b>McGonagall</b>: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?</dd>
            <dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.</dd>
            <dd><i>[There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from
                    the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man with shoulder length black hair and beard
                    named Rubeus Hagrid takes off his goggles.]</i></dd>
            <dd><b>Hagrid</b>: Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.</dd>
            <dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: No problems, I trust, Hagrid?</dd>
            <dd><b>Hagrid</b>: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to

                <dd><i>[They stop outside a house which is 4 Privet Drive.]</i></dd>
                <dd><b>McGonagall</b>: This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his
                    name.</dd>
                <dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.</dd>
                <dd><i>[Dumbledore places the baby on the ground slowly. Hagrid sniffles, he is sobbing a little. He
                        clears his throat.]</i></dd>

                <dd><i>[The baby has a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead. The camera slowly zooms towards the
                        scar which glows brightly and it immediately flashes, transitioning to a stormy cloud sky. The
                        film's title in metallic gold zooms out around the camera, and lightning flashes to brighten it
                        up. Then, the lightning flashes engulf the screen, transitioning it to the present time.]</i>
